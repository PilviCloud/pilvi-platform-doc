States At any particular time, a Service is in one of the following states: State Description WAITING_ACTIVATION The Service is created, but not yet provisioned. PROCESSING The Service is being provisioned or changes are being made to it. DISPATCHED The Service was created from a One-time Purchase Product (non-recurring), and it has been successfully provisioned. No other actions will be performed for this Service. OK The Service is successfully provisioned and is now active. SUSPENDED The Service is suspended. Access is limited while in this state. Possible reason: insufficient funds, Service misuse. ERRONEOUS The Service has experienced issues and may not be fully available. EXPIRED The Service has expired, it has been suspended and it is no longer accessible. The Service can still be renewed. DISCONTINUED The Service has been discontinued. The Service cannot be renewed, and it may be terminated at any given time. Trial period When Service trial period is nearing its end, an Invoice is created for the first billed period of the Service if auto-renew is enabled. If the Invoice was created, the payment is tried on the due date (Service expiration date), and on succesful payment the Service is renewed for the next period. Cancellation You may cancel a Service by disabling the auto-renew for it. To cancel a Service from the Console, proceed to the page of the Service that you'd like to cancel, and click on the 'Discontinue Service' button. If you still decide to continue to use the Service before it has been discontinued, you can click on the 'Continue Service' from the page of the Service. This will result in the creation of new Invoice that can be paid to renew the Service for the next period. Renewal Services are renewed by paying an Invoice that was created for the next billing period. Invoices are created before the Service expires, on the Service expiration date at the latest. Invoice creation times may vary between Sites. Auto-renew Services that have auto-renew enabled are automatically renewed for the next period (included on the next Invoice). Services that have been canceled (auto-renew disabled) will be excluded from the next periods Invoice, thus they will expire at the end of the current period. If you cancel a Service that has already been included in an Invoice for the next period, the Invoice will be reimbursed and a new Invoice reflecting the new state of the Contract will be created at a later time. Expiration Services will be expired when their expiration time is in the past. After the expiration date has passed, the Service may be put into EXPIRED state. The time period between the Service expiration time and the time the Service is put to EXPIRED state may vary between environments. While the Service is in EXPIRED state, it may still be renewed by paying the appropriate Invoice. Discontinuation Services will be discontinued when they have been in EXPIRED state for a predefined amount of time. This time period varies between Sites. When the Service is put to DISCONTINUED state, it cannot be renewed or restored. Contracts Contracts are used for grouping one or more Service. Services in the same Contract are renewed at the same time, and follow the same billing interval.","tags":"","url":"en\/Using_Pilvi\u2122\/Services.html"},{"title":"Getting Started","text":"For information on how to use Pilvi\u2122 Platform as a Customer, see Using Pilvi\u2122 - Getting Started To manage Pilvi Platform, you need to have access to a Seller Profile on the Pilvi Platform Site you intend to manage.

Products Products are orderable items that your Customers may purchase. Purchased Products become visible for the Customer as Services under the Profile the Product was purchased on. Products have a localized name optional plan name as well. Plan name is often used to separate different versions of the same Product, eg. Starter, Basic, Professional. Products have a localized description field that you can edit using a WYSIWYG editor. You can create content rich pages describing your products best features, using images and\/or videos. Provisioning method Provisioning method defines how the Product is provisioned when the Order is received and activated. Manual - Email. This provisioning method sends an email to the address defined by Preference: SERVICE_PROVISIONING_DEFAULT_EMAIL_ADDRESS with the Message Template: SERVICE_EMAIL_PROVISION. Automatic - PAITA. This provisioning method uses PAITA integration to provision the Service. PAITA integration needs to be setup before. See Service Integrations. Pricing Products have 3 different pricing options: Ask for an Offer. The Product cannot be purchased. Instead, contact information is presented. One-time purchase. A single price may be set. The Service will be provisioned, but no actions will be performed by Pilvi after that. Use cases: One-time purchase to receive something in exchange. Recurring. Product has a price for a certain period. The usage of the Service may be continued after the initially paid period has ended. Product may have a setup cost, that is paid only on the first order. Product may also have a Trial period. Life-time Product may be externally managed. Externally managed Products are not visible or purchasable in the Shop can cannot have a price. Externally managed Products are used when you want your Services to be provisioned from an outside source. Product Cards Product Cards may be used to provide different views to your Products. A Product may have many Product Cards that each can have a different theme and varying fields showing information about the Product. Product Cards are components that can be embedded to external websites. Product Card Groups Product Card Groups may be used to group Product Cards from different Products into a single element. Product Card Groups enable you to show a compare view of the Products, which shows what feature is available for each Product. Product Cards Groups are components that can be embedded to external websites. Relations Relations may be added between the products. In the Shop, these relations show as product recommendations in Product Detail and Product Configure. There are two relation types, group and single. If a new group relation is created, the current and the selected target product will be added to the group. More products can be added to the existing group. In the Shop, the products in the group relation will be shown as recommendations for each product in the group. A product may belong to several groups and single relations. The Single relation type is unidirectional. The product in the relation (target product) will be shown for the current product in the Shop. The current product won't be shown when inspecting the target product. Taxonomy types Taxonomy type Intended use case Where is shown? Variant Variations of the same Product.

Page has name, i.e. slug localized title localized content. The Page slug is unique within a Site and may only contain lowercase letters a-z, numbers and dashes, since it is used in URL. The title is plain text and editable. The content of the Page is HTML and can be edited with a WYSIWYG editor. When a page has been created in Manager, it is accessible in Shop via URL \/pages\/:name e.g. \/pages\/about-this. Note that a non-active page won't be visible in the Shop.

For example Product Detail, Product Configure, Login, Register, and Cart pages are supported. Each System Page can have several System Page Blocks, typically a Top and a Bottom block. The Top block is located just below the header and the Bottom block below the other content. The contents of the System Page Blocks can be edited in Manager as localized WYSIWYG fields. Default contents Some of the System Page Blocks have default contents. These contents can be edited similarly to any block. System Page Variables Variables can be used in System Page Blocks in the same way as in Pages. In addition to the Pages variables, System Pages may have page specific variables available. On Product Configure and Product Detail pages the following variables are available: Variable Name Where the Value comes from product.id The current product ID product.no The current product number product.name The current product localized name product.plan The current product localized plan Sections A System Page Block may contain sections, which visibility depends on the section variable values. The system defines these section variables on some of the System Pages. A section consists of section start, content, and section end.
